# My first app in React - ReactGirls mentoring

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Purpose of this project is to learn basics of React.js during 6 weeks of Prague [ReactGirls mentoring](https://reactgirls.com/mentoring) .

My mentor Veronika Gabrielov√° and I created a fake e-shop that is more visual than functional. The main goal was to learn how to properly divide the project into components and understand the communication between them.

*The project is left as it was created in mentorig. Only dependencies and major bugs in React are fixed later.*
